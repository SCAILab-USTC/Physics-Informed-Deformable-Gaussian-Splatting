# Towards Unified Constitutive Laws for Time-Evolving Material Field

![alt text](images/insights.jpg)

This is the official code implementation of the paper "Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting: Towards Unified Constitutive Laws for Time-Evolving Material Field". The paper is currently in the submission stage. We will open source each module in stages and release the complete code and dataset after the paper is accepted.

To do list：

- [X] Release Inference code
- [X] Release PIDG custom physics-driven synthetic dataset
- [ ] Release training code (including 4D decomposed hash encoding with dynamic and static decoupling, physical information material fields, and Lagrangian particle flows)
- [ ] Release CUDA/C++ rasteriser


```
